# Installation Git to AWS Ec2 
Let's run the following command
```
sudo yum install git

```
## Verify Git Installation
After the installation is complete, you can verify that Git is installed by checking its version:
```
git --version
```
## Configure Git (if necessary)
If you haven't configured Git with your name and email, you can do so with the following commands:
```
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"

```
Replace "Your Name" and "your.email@example.com" with your actual name and email address.
